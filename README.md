# Problems vs Algorithms

This repository contains my solution to Udacity's "Problems vs Algorithms` project, the third project in the [Data Structures and Algorithms Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-structures-and-algorithms-nanodegree--nd256)

## Prerequisites
* [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## How to run
Where `{i}` is the problem number
```
$ python3 ./problem_{i}/problem_{i}.py
```

### Note regarding problem 5
Problem 5 is different from the others as it is a Jupyter notebook and cannot be launched via Python directly.
