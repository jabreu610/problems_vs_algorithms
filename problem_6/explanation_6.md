# Explanation 6

## Rationale
For the "Max and Min in an Unsorted Array" problem, I opted to linearly scan the input array to determine the min and max values in a single traversal as stated in the requirements

## Runtime Analysis
The runtime complexity for this solution is `O(n)` where n is the length of the input array and its space complexity is `O(1)`. The runtime scales linearly with the input length as we traverse the input once to produce an correct result. Memory utilization is constant regardless of the input length
